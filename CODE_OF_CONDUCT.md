# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project embraces the use of AI tools for development. We believe in transparency about AI-assisted contributions:

### AI Tool Usage

We acknowledge that various AI tools (including but not limited to large language models, code assistants, and automated testing tools) may be used to:

- Generate code snippets and boilerplate
- Assist with refactoring and optimization
- Write documentation and comments
- Create test cases
- Suggest improvements and bug fixes
- Translate and localize content
- Provide code reviews and suggestions

### Expectations for AI-Assisted Contributions

When submitting AI-assisted contributions:

1. **Review and Verify**: All AI-generated code must be thoroughly reviewed and tested by a human contributor before submission

2. **Understand the Code**: Contributors should be able to explain and maintain any AI-generated code they submit

3. **Test Coverage**: AI-generated code should include appropriate tests to verify correctness

4. **Security**: All code, whether AI-generated or not, must follow security best practices

5. **Attribution**: While not required to explicitly credit AI tools in commit messages, we appreciate transparency about development practices

### Benefits of AI-Assisted Development

We believe AI tools can help:

- Increase development velocity
- Improve code quality through suggestions
- Reduce repetitive tasks
- Enable better accessibility features
- Assist with internationalization
- Provide diverse perspectives on problem-solving

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
