# Framework Selection Notes

## Web (React)

- Material UI (MUI): Mature, strong accessibility, fast to prototype.
- Ant Design: Enterprise-friendly, dense data layouts.
- Chakra UI: Simple theming and composition for rapid build.

## Cross-platform (React Native / Expo)

- React Native Paper: Material-based, reliable components.
- React Native Elements: Broad component set, simple setup.
- Tamagui: Shared design system across web and native; good for cross-platform parity.

## Selection guidance

- Choose MUI or Ant Design when data density and speed of delivery matter most.
- Choose Tamagui when web/native parity is a priority.
- Prefer Expo for faster iteration and simpler cross-platform tooling.
